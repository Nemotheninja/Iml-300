    <p> Trying to achieve equitable representation on screen for the latine community. We want our stories, our music, our food, and the vastness of our community to be shown. The latine community has experienced historical misrepresentation.
<br><br>
Why is it important to ensure that the entertainment industry tells diverse latinx stories?
 <br><br>
 Our perception of the world affects those around us. Thus, we must promote authentic latinx stories in film and television and latinx creators to tell these stories. 
<br><br>
Equitable hiring practices are important to ensuring one is telling an authentic story. If someone is not part of the latinx community then how would they be expected to understand the complexities of such a vibrant community.
