    <p> We are trying to achieve equitable representation on screen for the latine community. We want our stories, our music, our food, and the vastness of our culture to be shown. 
    <br><br>
Why is it important to ensure that the entertainment industry tells diverse latine stories?
<br><br>
The latine community has experienced historical misrepresentation in Hollywood. Latines are invisible on screen. When they are visible they typically play racist stereotypes such as the gangster or drug dealer. 

 <br><br>
 The media we consume affects the way we see the world and our perception of the world affects how we treat those around us.
 Thus, we must promote authentic latine stories in film and television to promote kindness and empathy for the Latine community. 
 <br><br>
 We must ensure that our stores are told accurately from a place of honesty. 
<br><br>
Equitable hiring practices are important to telling authentic stories. People not part of the latinx community have no right telling our stories. By hiring Latine creators to tell our stories we can ensure that our culture is not caricatured or mocked. 
<br><br>
To make this possible we must hold studios accountable for the shows/movies they produce. Members of the Latine community must be hired at all stages of production for shows/movies attempting to represent Latine culture. 
<br><br>
We need to hire Latine people behind the camera as well as in front of the camera. We must showcase Latine characters playing doctors, government officials, CEO's, scientists, and not just the roles typically allocated to us. 
<br><br>

This is an ongoing stuggle and the fight starts with us, the viewers, demanding better, more authentic shows and movies.
