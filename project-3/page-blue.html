    <p> Trying to achieve equitable representation on screen for the latine community. We want our stories, our music, our food, and the vastness of our community to be shown. 
    <br><br>
    The latine community has experienced historical misrepresentation in Hollywood.
<br><br>
Why is it important to ensure that the entertainment industry tells diverse latinx stories?
 <br><br>
 The media we consume affects the way we see the world and our perception of the world affects how we treat those around us.
 Thus, we must promote authentic latinx stories in film and television to promote kindness and empathy for the Latinx community. 
 <br><br>
 We must ensure that our stores are told accurately from a place of honesty. 
<br><br>
Equitable hiring practices are important to telling authentic stories. If someone is not part of the latinx community then how would they be expected to understand the complexities of such a vibrant community. By hiring Latinx creators to tell our stories we can ensure that our culture will not be characterized or mocked.
