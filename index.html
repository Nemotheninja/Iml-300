    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    
       <h1>Week 1 (Regret... Idk anything about code why am I in this class???)</h1>
       
       <p>
           
           I was fascinated to learn about the thought process of how artists were able to incorporate art into a digital era with computers. I had never thought of using coding as a creative art tool before taking his class, so it was very impressive to see that different forms of digital art have been around since the 1960s. Molnar’s anecdote on imagining an image from a hypothetical computer was incredible. I cannot imagine having the mind to understand how something would work without being able to see through trial and error. Colette and Charles Bangert’s work is also incredible and the pieces almost feel like figure drawings from the natural shapes and contours. It is very impressive to see what the combination of math and art can do. Some of my favorite work was from Aaron Marcus, with his abstract shapes and use of color, but also for his interactive environment. 

       </p>
       
        <h1>Week 2 (Everyone is so talented what am I doing here?)</h1>
        
        <p>
            Growing up in the silicon valley racial inequality is something that is very present. Some of us may know that Palo Alto is one of the most expensive cities in the United States, but what many may not know is that one of its neighboring cities, East Palo Alto, was historically one of the most dangerous cities in America. Due to redlining there is a racial divide between residents of Palo Alto and residents of East Palo Alto. Anti-Blackness is something that is not talked about in the tech space to the full extent that it should be. I think that until we can confront the problem of anti-blackness like this article does, we cannot find a solution. This is very evident in the article with the way that it forces the reader to read a black page. 
        </p>
        
        <h1>Week 3 (Coding is pretty fun)</h1>
<p>
   It is incredibly strange to think about how new the internet is, especially since it is something that is so ingrained in our society. Our lives have completely changed because of the internet from the jobs available to what we do in our spare time. This article reminds me that there is almost never a time in my life when I am not using the internet. It is always there with any question I could possibly need to lookup. Like the author, I remember in the early 2000s playing video games and chatting with strangers in chat rooms. I was just a child, but I was searching for what every human searches for, human connection. The fakeness we now see in youtube videos, from the studio lights to the quick editing is not something that I had consciously thought about. The internet was a place where someone could be their authentic selves and now it is more of a marketing tool. 
    </p>
    
    <h1>Week 4 (I need to try harder and prove I deserve to be here)</h1>
    <p>
    I found today's screening to be extremely inspirational and unique. I love seeing work like  Lauren McCarthy’s that pushes the boundaries of what art can be. Fear of technology is something that is extremely relatable to most of us in this day and age. Our world changes at a pace that is very hard to keep up with. I really enjoyed her project of watching someone through cameras and anticipating what a person will want better than an AI. It does a great job of calling into question ordinary things that we rely on from technology. I have sir activated on my phone and my parents have an Alexa in their home.
    </p> 
     
    <h1>Week 5 (Im so embarrassed, I hate public speaking)</h1>
      <p>
      I found the approach to “poor images” to be fascinating. I had never thought so deeply into something which is so looked down upon in our society. It seems like most articles written about memes only focus on the negative aspects, from the toxicity to the neonazism, but this article made me see memes in a different light. What I found most interesting was her discussion about elitism in cinema and how the “poor image” is a rebellion against it. I feel as though even now I hear people trying to gatekeep the doors to enter the world of cinema with the kinds of cameras one needs or the budget, but I enjoy seeing that memes can blur the lines between author and audience and do something that cinema cannot do.  The “poor image” becomes an economy and a space to share ideas as it is passed around from person to person. The image looking poor gives it a seal of authenticity. It shows how much an image is distributed through the network of the internet. I enjoyed this article because I was never truly part of this world and culture. This gave me a new appreciation for “poor images”.
      </p>
      
     <h1>Week 6 (Everyone is so kind I think Im going to cry)</h1>
     <p>
         I found this ted talk very informative. The issue of biases in algorithms is one which I was aware of but I did not realize the scope of how widespread this problem was. This issue stems from a lack of diversity in the tech space. Those in the tech space are primarily white and male meaning they design technology for people who are like them. The biased of AI is not something that happens intentionally but rather comes from a lack of foresight and lack of hiring POC professionals. When technology is created only from a specific type of person there are bound to be holes in the product. We need more women and people of color in the tech space to offset this. This Ted Talk reminded me of a story I heard a while back about how Facebook’s AI would label black people as Gorillas. This story is just another example of people being forgotten about in the tech space. There is no excuse for people to be missing from AI networks and the solution is simple. 
     </p> 
     <h1>Week 7 (Finding a community. Inviting friends over to code. Long nights, fun memories, dancing, laughing, map friends)</h1>
     
      <p>
     I really enjoyed this ted talk because it reflected a lot of my own experiences. Biases are something that we as humans all have and the single-story is something that we must remain vigilant of. It can be very easy to only have one world view whether this comes from the news we watch, the country we are from, or the people we interact with. Everyone can benefit from learning about views that contrast their own opinions. 
For the P5js contributor's zine, I was very interested to read Aarón Montoya-Moraga’s reflection. Spanish was my first language and I have worked tutoring bilingual and Spanish-speaking students. Code is something that should be accessible to everyone so I appreciate the effort to translate the p5.js website and book to Spanish and also run workshops. With English being such a universal language, one does not think about how big of a barrier language can be unless they have experienced adversity because of the language they speak. 
I love the idea of honoring the land and acknowledging and managing the material waste a project generates. I also really love the idea of honoring one's body and taking care of your health while working on code. This practice should be important to maintain in anything you do. 
     </p> 
     
       <h1>Week 8 (Whats the difference between div and id?)</h1>
       
       <p>
           I found the video about Omni Specialized design to be very interesting. I believe that it should always be important to have the user in mind when creating something. Adding the user to the team when creating a product can give us a lot of guidance about the potential effects of the product. Ari Melenciano’s description of the linear design economy was something I never thought of as being a choice that we make as humans. There is a lot of waste that is created when making a product. When a new generation of iphones comes out, we throw away our old one. This is true in tech space but also in other spaces as well. Through circular design and ecolologically centered deign nothing is wasted. I think this is a good practice for any field to copy. Using raw materials that can be recycled and making sure our products benefit everyone, not just humans, is very important.
       </p>
       
        <h1>Week 9 (Thankful for Q and Katherine and this class for everything I have learned and the people I have met. This has been my favorite class in college)</h1>
        
        <p>
       Forest of Things by Manuel Tozzi captured my imagination with its creativity and atmosphere. I found myself fascinated and highly engaged as I walked around the dark forest and interacted with different characters. With little story, the player is forced to make up their own interpretations of the world and weird creatures found in the forest.
